    headLine: `Born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia and currently living in New York City. I graduated college majoring in Hospitality Management and worked at Five-Star hotel and restaurants before I made the move to the United States. Leaving everything I've known my entire life was not an easy decision, but I made some good progress while trying to survive in the Big Apple.                        
    I did some learning on how to code by myself while also working full-time, but eventually enrolled in Flatiron School Software Engineering BootCamp and it has kick-started what I've been wanting to get my hands on ever since I was little, which is getting a behind-the-scenes look of an app. 
    
    I enjoy running, traveling, badminton, video games and also building web apps. It has become a passion of mine once my coding journey began. If you are an employer, you can get in touch with me here.`,
